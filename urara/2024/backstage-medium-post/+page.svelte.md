## Check out my article on Backstage

I wrote an [article](https://medium.com/elca-it/platform-engineering-building-a-portal-for-developers-with-backstage-c51e74662eba) about the adoption of [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) as a central hub for developers in my company. My team and I oversee 600 projects with assets on both public cloud and on-premises, including Jenkins controllers and Azure subscriptions.

In this [Medium post](https://medium.com/elca-it/platform-engineering-building-a-portal-for-developers-with-backstage-c51e74662eba), I present how Backstage serves as an Internal Developer Platform (IDP), streamlining the management of these diverse resources and providing self-service capabilities for software engineering Teams in [ELCA](https://www.elca.ch/en) company.

I worked the last few months on integrating and developing custom plugins for self-service tooling and asset management. The stack of a Backstage plugin is quite standard:

- Backstage is a monorepo structure with plugins in separate folders.
- In the frontend, we use React.
- The backend uses NodeJS and Express for APIs.

Now, this Backstage instance is in production and also used by developers to deploy and manage their resources
