## Introduction

Recently, I decided to learn typescript by working on a small project called [vaporflow-startpage](https://github.com/gaelgoth/vaporflow-startpage), a customizable browser start page. While I had some experience with JavaScript and Vue.js, I had never worked with typescript and React before. Here's how I went about learning typescript through this project.

<div class="alert shadow-inner">
  <div>
    <span class="text-lg i-simple-icons-github !w-5 !h-5"></span>
    <div>
      <a href="https://github.com/gaelgoth/vaporflow-startpage"><h3 class="font-bold my-0">gaelgoth/vaporflow-startpage</h3></a>
      <div class="text-xs">Vaporflow is a browser start page with daisyui distinctive aesthetic, featuring OpenWeather</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## The idea

I started my typescript journey by using the [React Vite Boilerplate](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite), which provided a great starting point for building my own Chrome extension. While exploring various open source projects, I stumbled upon [r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/) subreddit, where I discovered numerous custom browser start page projects. I was inspired by the designs and decided to create my own start page with a minimalist approach that suits my needs.

## The implementation

The code is very (very) simple and contains avoidable duplications. In addition to the bookmarks, I have integrated the weather display using OpenWeather and a theme picker. After completing my first version of the start page, I shared it on the r/startpage subreddit. To my surprise, it received a strong positive response from the community. This unexpected success has made vaporflow-startpage my most popular project to date ðŸ˜„.

## Lessons Learned

Working on [vaporflow-startpage](https://github.com/gaelgoth/vaporflow-startpage) has been an exciting journey for me to learn typescript and React. By starting with a boilerplate and exploring various open source projects, I was able to develop my own custom browser start page. Through this process, I learned the basics of typescript and React, as well as how to integrate APIs like OpenWeather.

## Conclusion

The positive response from the r/startpage community has been an added bonus and has inspired me to improve and maintain this small project. I look forward to creating more exciting projects in the future.
